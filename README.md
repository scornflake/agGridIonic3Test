# agGridIonic3Test

This is a simple test of ag-Grid, attempting to use it within Ionic, but have the header 'sticky' below the page header.


- Do a npm install.
- Then: ionic serve
- Scroll up/down. The ag-Grid header disappears *under* the ionic page header (the one saying 'Grid Test')

Uses faker to create a fake grid.
